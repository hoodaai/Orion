/**
 * In this class there are two threads, one is main thread and another is ReaderThread.
 * This program illustrates what can go wrong if two threads share data without synchronization
 * <p/>
 * There is no guarantee that operations in one thread will be performed in the order
 * given by the program, as long as the reordering is not detectable from within that
 * thread even if the reordering is apparent to other threads.
 * This may  seem  like  a  broken  design,  but  it  is  meant  to  allow  JVMs  to
 * take  full advantage of the  performance  of  modern  multiprocessor hardware.
 * For example, in the absence of synchronization, the Java Memory Model permits the
 * compiler to reorder operations and cache values in registers, and permits CPUs to
 * reorder operations and cache values in processor‚Äêspecific caches
